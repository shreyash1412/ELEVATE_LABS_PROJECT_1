# ELEVATE_LABS_PROJECT_1
This project is based on the title of Youtube Trending Video Analytics
The YouTube Trending Video Analytics report provides a detailed picture of viewer behavior, content popularity, and overall platform trends over the years. A total of 268.787K views have been accumulated across 46.607K videos, reflecting the significant reach of trending content on the platform. With an average of 131.47K likes per video and a total of 16 million liked videos, audience engagement appears overwhelmingly positive. In contrast, dislikes were relatively low at 879K, suggesting that most viewers have favorable reactions to the trending content. Furthermore, 7 million comments show a healthy level of viewer interaction and community discussion. Looking at the yearly trends, 2021 stands out as the peak year in terms of both views and video uploads. With 74.6K videos, it holds the record for the highest count of content entering the trending space, followed closely by 2022 and 2023. Interestingly, 2023 slightly edges out 2021 in total views, making it the most viewed year overall. However, 2024 shows a sharp drop in both video count and views, likely due to the year being incomplete or in progress at the time of analysis. The chart displaying likes and dislikes by year reinforces this narrative: likes peaked in 2021, and while they dipped slightly after that, they remained strong through 2023. Meanwhile, dislikes declined sharply post-2021, possibly reflecting changes in platform policy or shifts in audience behavior. Category-wise, a few content types dominate the trending space. Category ID 24 leads significantly with 32.56% of all views (239 billion views). This is followed by Category 10 with 25.57% (188 billion) and Category 20 with 12.14% (89 billion). These three categories alone account for over 70% of all trending video views, highlighting the concentrated popularity of certain genres. Other categories contribute smaller shares, but still demonstrate the diversity present within trending content. Additionally, the dashboard provides a glimpse into daily trending activity from August 2020, showing individual videos, their titles, and the associated channel and category. This historic snapshot helps illustrate how trends develop day by day and what kind of content gains rapid popularity in short bursts. In conclusion, the analytics show that YouTube's trending section is fueled by strong audience engagement, specific high-performing content categories, and standout years like 2021 and 2023. Creators aiming to break into the trending space should focus on producing compelling content within popular categories and maintaining consistent quality and viewer interaction. The overall sentiment is clear: trending videos are widely liked, frequently commented on, and dominated by a few key types of content that resonate most with the global audience.
